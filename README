NAME
    DynScalar - closure-in-a-box for simple scalars

SYNOPSYS
      use DynScalar;  # imports as dynamic()
      use strict;
      use vars '$name';

      my $foo = dynamic { "Hello, $name!\n" };
      for $name ("Jeff", "Joe", "Jonas") { print $foo }

DESCRIPTION
    This module creates closures, and masks them as objects that
    stringify themselves when used. This allows you to make
    incredibly simplistic string templates:

      use DynScalar 'delay';  # import as delay()
      use strict;
      use vars qw( $name $age $sex );

      my $template = delay {
        "Hello, $name.  You're a good-looking $age-year-old $sex.\n"
      };

      while (my $rec = get_person()) {
        ($name,$age,$sex) = $rec->features;
        print $template;
      }

    You can embed arbitrarily complex code in the block.

CAVEATS
    You should only use package variables in the block -- lexically
    scoped variables can not be seen.
